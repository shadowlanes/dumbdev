# 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons

## Meaning

The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand (for example, censorship or government-mandated blocked content).

## When to Use

When access to a resource is blocked due to legal reasons – such as a court order, law, or regulation – and the server is giving an explicit status code to indicate this. Often used to transparently inform the user that the resource is intentionally unavailable for legal compliance.

## Example

A website hosted in one country returns 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons to users from a region where a specific page or item has been legally prohibited (e.g., a news article censored by law). The response might include an explanation or link to the legal authority.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for general authorization or authentication issues. Only use 451 when there's a legal or policy reason preventing access. If a resource is removed or unavailable for non-legal reasons, use other appropriate codes (404, 410, etc.).
