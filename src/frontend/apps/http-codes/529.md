# 529 Site is overloaded

## Meaning

A non-standard code used by certain services (e.g., Qualys SSL Labs API) to indicate that the site (or service) is temporarily overloaded and cannot process the request.

## When to Use

When a service has a custom mechanism to signal overload separate from the standard 503. Qualys’s SSL Labs API, for example, uses 529 to tell clients that the server is busy or over capacity.

## Example

Querying the SSL Labs analysis API during peak times might result in a 529 Site is overloaded, meaning the service cannot handle the request at the moment and the client should try again later.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in general implementations as it’s not an official status code. For typical overload situations, 503 Service Unavailable (potentially with Retry-After) should be used. 529 is very specific to certain providers’ conventions.
