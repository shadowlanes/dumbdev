# 424 Failed Dependency

## Meaning

The request failed because it depended on another operation that failed. This is used in contexts like WebDAV where an earlier request (e.g., a PROPPATCH) failed, causing the current request to fail as well.

## When to Use

When an operation cannot succeed because a previous action in the context failed. Often used in multi-step or batch processing scenarios to indicate that the chain of operations was broken by a failure earlier.

## Example

If a client attempts a WebDAV PROPPATCH on a resource after a previous related operation failed (like locking the resource), the server might return 424 Failed Dependency to indicate it can't proceed due to that earlier failure.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in single-operation requests that aren't dependent on prior requests. This is typically relevant in multi-part or transaction-like requests where one part failing affects another.
