# 401 Unauthorized

## Meaning

The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.

## When to Use

When authentication is required and has either failed or not been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field with a challenge for the client.

## Example

Accessing a protected endpoint without a valid token returns 401 Unauthorized, prompting the client to provide credentials (WWW-Authenticate header might indicate the required scheme).

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the client is authenticated but not allowed to access the resource (use 403 Forbidden in that case).

## Source

RFC 9110
