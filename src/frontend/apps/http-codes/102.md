# 102 Processing

## Meaning

Indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.

## When to Use

When a request (such as a WebDAV request) involves complex operations and will take long to complete.

## Example

A WebDAV PROPPATCH request triggers a 102 Processing to prevent the client from timing out while the server works.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for quick operations; only for lengthy requests. Note: This status code is deprecated and not used in HTTP/1.1 clients.

## Source

RFC 2518 (WebDAV)
