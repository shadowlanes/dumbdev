# 530 Site is frozen / Origin Unavailable

## Meaning

A non-standard status code with different meanings depending on context: Pantheon hosting uses 530 to indicate a site has been frozen (usually for inactivity or billing issues), while Cloudflare/Shopify have used 530 when the origin host is unreachable (for instance, DNS failure or other origin errors).

## When to Use

Pantheon: use 530 when a site is taken offline or "frozen" due to inactivity or account issues. Cloudflare/Shopify: use 530 as an error when the origin cannot be reached at all (similar to a DNS or routing error that prevents connecting to the origin).

## Example

Pantheon’s platform might return 530 Site is frozen if a website has been archived due to the user not upgrading or it being idle. In a DNS context, Cloudflare may also return a 530 if it cannot resolve the origin's DNS or otherwise finds the origin unavailable, although Cloudflare more commonly uses 523 or other codes for similar situations.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in standard HTTP situations, as 530 is not officially defined. These are very specific uses: Pantheon’s internal handling or Cloudflare/Shopify's error signaling. Use standard codes (such as 503 or 523) for general cases of site unavailability or DNS issues in your own systems.
