# 419 Page Expired

## Meaning

A non-standard status code used by some frameworks (e.g., Laravel) to indicate that a session or token has expired.

## When to Use

When a CSRF token or session has expired and the server rejects the request for security reasons, frameworks like Laravel use 419 to signify this client-side issue.

## Example

In Laravel, an AJAX request with an expired CSRF token returns 419 Page Expired, prompting the client to refresh or reauthenticate.

## When Not to Use

Do not use outside of specific frameworks or contexts that expect 419. For standard HTTP, there's no official 419 code; other codes like 401 or 403 might be used depending on the scenario.

## Source

Unofficial (Laravel Framework)
