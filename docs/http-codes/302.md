# 302 Found

## Meaning

The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. The client should use the URI from the response for this request, but future requests can still use the original URI.

## When to Use

When redirecting to a different URI temporarily (for example, during maintenance or as part of a temporary redirect logic).

## Example

A web page temporarily moved to a maintenance page returns 302 Found with a Location header to the temporary page, while the original URL remains the same for future requests.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for permanent redirection (use 301 or 308) or when the resource actually has multiple representations (not a redirect scenario).

RFC 9110
