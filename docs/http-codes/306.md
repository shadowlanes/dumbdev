# 306 Switch Proxy

## Meaning

This code is no longer used. It was once proposed to indicate that subsequent requests should use a specified proxy, but it was never implemented.

## When to Use

Never; this status code is reserved and not used in modern HTTP. It remains only as a placeholder for historical reasons.

## Example

N/A (306 is not used in practice, so no example of a real HTTP exchange).

## When Not to Use

Do not use this code at all. It is reserved and has no effect in HTTP/1.1 clients or servers.

## Source

RFC 2616 (reserved, unused)
