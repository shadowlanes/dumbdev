# 226 IM Used

## Meaning

The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations (Delta encoding) applied to the current instance.

## When to Use

When a server has applied a delta encoding to a representation and is returning the result (indicating that the response is not a full new resource but a manipulated instance).

## Example

A server returns 226 IM Used in response to a GET that included an "A-IM" header (Acceptable Instance-Manipulations) to indicate it applied a delta update to the content.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if no instance-manipulation was applied; use 200 OK or another appropriate status for normal responses.
