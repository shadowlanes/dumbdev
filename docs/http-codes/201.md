# 201 Created

## Meaning

The request was successful and led to the creation of a new resource.

## When to Use

When a new resource has been created as the result of a POST or some PUT requests.

## Example

POST /api/users with a new user returns 201 Created and typically includes a Location header pointing to the new user.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if no new resource is actually created (use 200 or other appropriate code instead).
