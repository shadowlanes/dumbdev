# 406 Not Acceptable

## Meaning

The server cannot generate a response that is acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.

## When to Use

When content negotiation fails: the client’s Accept (or similar) headers specify a response format that the server cannot fulfill, so no suitable representation is available.

## Example

A client requests /data with Accept: text/xml, but the server only produces JSON; it returns 406 Not Acceptable to indicate it cannot provide content in the requested format.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the server chooses to ignore the Accept header and send a default format (then 200 could be used). Only use 406 when the server actively honors Accept headers and finds no match.

## Source

RFC 9110
