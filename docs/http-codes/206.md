# 206 Partial Content

## Meaning

The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.

## When to Use

When fulfilling a request with a Range header, returning the specified portion of the resource (used for resumable downloads or splitting downloads).

## Example

GET /file.zip with a Range header returns 206 Partial Content with the requested byte range of the file and a Content-Range header.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if no range was requested or if the full content is being delivered (use 200 for the entire content).

## Source

RFC 9110
