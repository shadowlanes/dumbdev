# 203 Non-Authoritative Information

## Meaning

The request was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that of the origin server's 200 OK response by a transforming proxy.

## When to Use

When a proxy or intermediary modifies the origin's response (e.g., removing or changing headers or content) before relaying it to the client.

## Example

A caching proxy returns 203 Non-Authoritative Information to indicate it is returning a cached copy that has been modified from the original.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the response is identical to the origin's content (in that case use 200) or if no transformation was applied.
