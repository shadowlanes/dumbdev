# 204 No Content

## Meaning

The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content in the body.

## When to Use

When a request is successful but there is no need to return a body (commonly after executing a DELETE or when updating a resource without returning data).

## Example

DELETE /api/items/123 returns 204 No Content on successful deletion with no response body.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if there is content to send in the response. Any content in a 204 response will be ignored by the client.

## Source

RFC 9110
