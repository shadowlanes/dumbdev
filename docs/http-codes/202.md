# 202 Accepted

## Meaning

The request has been received but not yet acted upon; processing will happen asynchronously.

## When to Use

When the server accepts a request for processing, but the processing is not completed when the response is sent (e.g., long-running job, batch processing).

## Example

Submitting a background job returns 202 Accepted to indicate the request was received and will be processed later.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the server has already completed the action and can provide a synchronous response.

## Source

RFC 9110
