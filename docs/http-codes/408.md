# 408 Request Timeout

## Meaning

The server timed out waiting for the request. The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait.

## When to Use

When the server closes the connection due to a client’s slow request or inactivity. It indicates that the client may retry the request at a later time without modifications.

## Example

If a client begins a request but stops sending data for too long, the server may respond with 408 Request Timeout and close the connection to free up resources.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the server has received and is processing the request (then the response should be based on that processing, not a timeout). Typically, 408 is generated by the server automatically rather than by application logic.
