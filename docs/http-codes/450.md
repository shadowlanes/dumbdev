# 450 Blocked by Windows Parental Controls

## Meaning

A Microsoft extension code indicating that the request was blocked due to Windows Parental Controls being turned on.

## When to Use

Used by Microsoft (for example, in Windows Live Family Safety) when content is blocked for a user due to parental control settings. The server or intermediary filters the request and returns this status to explain the block.

## Example

When a child account attempts to access a site or resource disallowed by parental controls, the system may return 450 Blocked by Windows Parental Controls, indicating the content is blocked by policy.

## When Not to Use

Do not use outside the context of Microsoft’s parental control systems. It's not a standard HTTP status. For general content filtering, a 403 Forbidden might be used with a custom message instead.

## Source

Unofficial (Microsoft)
