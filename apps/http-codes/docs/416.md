# 416 Range Not Satisfiable

## Meaning

The client has asked for a portion of the resource (via the Range header), but the server cannot supply that portion. Often because the requested range is outside the size of the target file.

## When to Use

When responding to a Range request where the range specifications cannot be met. The server should include a Content-Range header indicating the valid range if possible.

## Example

If a client requests bytes 500-999 of a file that is only 300 bytes long, the server responds with 416 Range Not Satisfiable, possibly including Content-Range: */300 to indicate the size.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for requests without Range headers. If the request isn't a range request, there's no range to be unsatisfiable (other errors might apply instead if something else is wrong).
