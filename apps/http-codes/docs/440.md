# 440 Login Time-out

## Meaning

A Microsoft IIS/Exchange specific status indicating that the user's session has expired or is not authenticated, essentially a login timeout.

## When to Use

When a client’s session or token has expired on a Microsoft server (like an Outlook Web Access session), and the server directs the client to reauthenticate. This is not an official HTTP status but used by some Microsoft products.

## Example

In some versions of Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint, if a user's session cookie is expired, the server may return 440 Login Time-out, prompting the client to redirect to a login page.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in non-Microsoft contexts. This is not part of the official HTTP standard. For standard applications, a 401 or 403 with a login page would be used instead.

## Source

Unofficial (Microsoft IIS/Exchange)
