# 527 Railgun Error

## Meaning

A Cloudflare-specific code (now obsolete) indicating an error with the Railgun protocol (Cloudflare's WAN optimization tool) between Cloudflare and the origin. It meant that the connection between Cloudflare and the Railgun server had an issue.

## When to Use

When Cloudflare was using Railgun to accelerate connections to an origin, and that connection broke or experienced an error, Cloudflare would return a 527 to denote that the specialized connection failed. This code is not used anymore as Railgun is deprecated.

## Example

A Cloudflare-enabled site with Railgun might have returned 527 if the Railgun listener at the origin crashed or if the Railgun connection was interrupted. The user would see a 527 error page indicating a Railgun communication error.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in any current context. As this code is tied to a deprecated feature, it's effectively not seen in modern use. If not using Cloudflare or Railgun, you would never encounter or emit this code.

## Source

Unofficial (Cloudflare, deprecated)
