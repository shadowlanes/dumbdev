# 407 Proxy Authentication Required

## Meaning

The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. Similar to 401 Unauthorized, but for proxy usage.

## When to Use

When a request is being made through a proxy that requires authentication and the proper credentials have not been provided. The proxy must return a Proxy-Authenticate header with a challenge.

## Example

A client trying to browse the web through a corporate proxy without logging in receives 407 Proxy Authentication Required, indicating it needs to provide valid proxy credentials.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for origin server authentication (use 401 for that). This is specific to proxies requiring authentication before forwarding client requests.

## Source

RFC 9110
