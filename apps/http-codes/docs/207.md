# 207 Multi-Status

## Meaning

The message body contains an XML document with multiple separate response codes, typically for batch or multi-part operations (WebDAV).

## When to Use

When a WebDAV request (like PROPFIND or a batch operation) needs to return status for multiple independent sub-requests in a single response.

## Example

A WebDAV PROPFIND returns 207 Multi-Status with an XML body containing status codes for each file operation in the request.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for single-resource requests. This is specific to situations where multiple outcomes need to be reported together.

## Source

RFC 4918 (WebDAV)
