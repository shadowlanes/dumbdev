# 410 Gone

## Meaning

The target resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be permanent.

## When to Use

When a resource used to exist but has been intentionally removed, and you want to inform clients that it will not be available again in the future.

## Example

A specific article URL that has been deleted from a site could return 410 Gone to indicate it was intentionally removed and will not be coming back, signaling clients or search engines to remove references.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for temporary unavailability (use 404 or 503 depending on the scenario). If the condition might be reversed or is not permanent, use a different status.
