# 208 Already Reported

## Meaning

The members of a WebDAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous part of the response, and are not being included again.

## When to Use

When a WebDAV request has multiple operations on the same resource (like a DAV binding), and you have already reported its status in a 207 Multi-Status response to avoid duplication.

## Example

A DAV PROPFIND on a collection returns 207, and if a member was already reported, subsequent multi-status parts might use 208 Already Reported for that member.

## When Not to Use

Do not use outside of WebDAV multi-status responses. If each resource’s status is unique, report them individually instead of using 208.

## Source

RFC 5842 (WebDAV)
