# 103 Early Hints

## Meaning

Used to return some response headers before the final HTTP response is sent.

## When to Use

When the server wants to hint to the client (often a browser) about resources it can preload while the final response is being prepared.

## Example

Server sends 103 Early Hints with Link headers (preload hints) before sending a final 200 OK response.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if there are no preliminary headers to send or if not using link preload strategies.

## Source

RFC 8297
