# 205 Reset Content

## Meaning

The server successfully processed the request, and is not returning content, but it expects the client to reset the document view that sent the request.

## When to Use

When you want the client to clear form input or reset the UI after a successful action, without returning content.

## Example

After a form submission that clears data, the server returns 205 Reset Content to instruct the client to reset the form view.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if the client should not reset its view or if you need to return content (use 204 for no content without requiring a reset).

RFC 9110
