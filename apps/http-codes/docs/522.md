# 522 Connection Timed Out

## Meaning

A Cloudflare-specific status indicating that the proxy did not receive a timely response from the origin server. It is essentially a timeout between Cloudflare and the origin.

## When to Use

When Cloudflare can connect to the origin server but the server takes too long to respond to the request. This is similar to a 504 but specifically in the context of Cloudflare communicating with the origin.

## Example

If the origin server is overwhelmed or slow and doesn't respond to Cloudflare's request within Cloudflare’s timeout window, Cloudflare returns a 522 Connection Timed Out to the client to signal the upstream timeout.

## When Not to Use

Do not use directly on origin servers. This is meant for proxies/gateways. If you are implementing a proxy or load balancer and want a similar concept, you might use 504 Gateway Timeout. 522 is part of Cloudflare’s nomenclature for timeouts.
