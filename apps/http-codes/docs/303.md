# 303 See Other

## Meaning

The response to the request can be found at another URI using the GET method. This is used to direct the client to retrieve a resource at a different URI, often after a POST.

## When to Use

When a resource has been created or a command processed via POST/PUT/DELETE, and you want the client to retrieve a confirmation or result from a different URI with a GET.

## Example

After submitting a form (POST /submit-form), the server responds with 303 See Other and a Location header to /result-page, instructing the client to GET that URL for the results.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for GET requests (since the client can directly retrieve content) or for permanent redirect needs (use 301/308 for those). 303 is typically for redirecting after non-GET methods.
