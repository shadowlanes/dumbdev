# 300 Multiple Choices

## Meaning

Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (different format options or disambiguation).

## When to Use

When there are multiple representations for a resource and the server cannot automatically choose one, requiring the user or agent to select (content negotiation results in multiple available formats).

## Example

Accessing a resource that has different format variants (like /document with HTML and PDF versions) could return 300 Multiple Choices with a list of links to all versions.

## When Not to Use

Do not use if there is a preferred or single representation that can be served directly (in such cases use a direct 200 or a redirect to the best choice).
