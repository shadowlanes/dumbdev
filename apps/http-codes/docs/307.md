# 307 Temporary Redirect

## Meaning

The request should be repeated with another URI, but future requests should still use the original URI. Unlike 302, the HTTP method is not changed when reissuing the original request.

## When to Use

When temporarily redirecting to a different URL and you want to preserve the request method on redirect (HTTP/1.1 behavior).

## Example

A POST to an endpoint returns 307 Temporary Redirect with Location pointing to a maintenance page; the client will repeat the POST to that maintenance URL, then continue to use the original URL later.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for permanent changes (use 308 Permanent Redirect or 301) or if you intend to allow changing the method (use 302/303 in those cases).
