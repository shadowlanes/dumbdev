# 301 Moved Permanently

## Meaning

The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI, and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.

## When to Use

When a resource has been permanently moved to a new URL and the client should use the new URL for all future requests.

## Example

A GET request to an old endpoint returns 301 Moved Permanently with a Location header pointing to the resource's new permanent URL.

## When Not to Use

Do not use for temporary relocations (use 302 or 307 instead) or when the move is not permanent.

## Source

RFC 9110
