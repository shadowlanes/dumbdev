# 783 Unexpected Token

## Meaning

A non-standard status code used by Shopify to indicate that the request contained a JSON syntax error. Essentially the server couldn't parse the JSON in the request.

## When to Use

When a Shopify API endpoint receives a request with malformed JSON (invalid syntax), it may return 783 Unexpected Token to specifically denote that the JSON could not be parsed (unexpected token encountered in the JSON text).

## Example

A client sends a POST to the Shopify API with a malformed JSON body (e.g., missing a comma or curly brace); Shopify responds with 783 Unexpected Token, meaning it found an unexpected token in the JSON and couldn’t parse the request body.

## When Not to Use

Do not use in standard APIs. The proper response for a JSON parse error in a request would typically be 400 Bad Request with an error message. 783 is a very specialized code not recognized outside of Shopify’s context.
