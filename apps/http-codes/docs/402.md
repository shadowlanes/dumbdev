# 402 Payment Required

## Meaning

Reserved for future use. Intended for cases where payment is required for access, but no standard use currently exists.

## When to Use

Rarely used in practice. Could be used in experimental or proprietary APIs to indicate the client needs to pay (or has exceeded a quota) before the request can be fulfilled.

## Example

Some APIs might return 402 Payment Required if a user has exceeded a usage quota or needs to upgrade their plan (though 402 is not widely adopted).

## When Not to Use

Do not use for general unsuccessful requests. Since there's no official standard implementation for 402, it's usually avoided or repurposed in limited cases.

## Source

RFC 9110
