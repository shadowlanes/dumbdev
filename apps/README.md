## Development Workflow

### Working with Original Source

If you need to reference or update the original source code:

1. Make changes in this directory (`apps/`)
2. Test the original app if needed
3. Apply changes to the migrated version in `/docs/`
4. Rebuild the main site

### Adding a New App

1. Create the app source in `apps/new-app/`
2. Create the migrated version in `docs/new-app/`
3. Update `/docs/.vitepress/config.ts` with navigation
4. Add feature card to landing page (`/docs/index.md`)
5. Update main README.md
